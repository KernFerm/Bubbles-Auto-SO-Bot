# 🚀 Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot 🎉

## What is Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot?
Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot is a powerful and automated Twitch bot designed to enhance engagement in your chat by automatically giving shoutouts to streamers/viewers/followers who participate in your channel. This bot helps promote other streamers and fosters a supportive Twitch community by recognizing active chatters and encouraging networking.

### ✨ Features:
- 🤖 **Automatic Shoutouts:** No need for manual commands—streamers get an automatic shoutout when they chat.
- ⏳ **Cooldown System:** Prevents excessive shoutouts by enforcing a 30-minute cooldown per user.
- 🚫 **Ignore List:** The bot will not shoutout known Twitch bots or the broadcaster.
- 🎮 **Game Information:** When a user is live, the bot includes their current game in the shoutout.
- 🔗 **Twitch IRC Connection:** Seamlessly integrates into Twitch chat without the need for additional configuration.

## ⚡ How the Bot Works
1. When a user chats in your stream, the bot checks:
   - 🕒 If the user has already received a shoutout in the last 30 minutes.
   - 🚫 It will ignore known bots (from the ignore list).
   - 🎥 If the user is the broadcaster (the bot does not shout out the channel owner).
2. If all conditions are met, the bot sends a message like:
```
🚀 Hey everyone! Check this incredible person out, @${username} is an amazing supporter! @${tags.username} is showing love to @${username}! ❤️✨ Make sure to drop them a follow and show your support! Twitch channel at https://twitch.tv/${username}! 🎉  
```
