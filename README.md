# 🚀 Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot 🎉

## What is Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot?
Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot is a powerful and automated Twitch bot designed to enhance engagement in your chat by automatically giving shoutouts to streamers/viewers/followers who participate in your channel. This bot helps promote other streamers and fosters a supportive Twitch community by recognizing active chatters and encouraging networking.

### ✨ Features:
- 🤖 **Automatic Shoutouts:** No need for manual commands—`streamers/viewers/followers` get an automatic shoutout when they chat.
- ⏳ **Cooldown System:** Prevents excessive shoutouts by enforcing a `30-minute` cooldown per user.
- 🚫 **Ignore List:** The bot will not shoutout known `Twitch bots` or the `broadcaster`.
- 🔗 **Twitch IRC Connection:** Seamlessly integrates into Twitch chat without the need for additional configuration.
