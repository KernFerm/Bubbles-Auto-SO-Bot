# 🚀 Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot 🎉

## What is Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot?
Bubbles Auto Shoutout Bot is a powerful and automated Twitch bot designed to enhance engagement in your chat by automatically giving shoutouts to streamers who participate in your channel. This bot helps promote other streamers and fosters a supportive Twitch community by recognizing active chatters and encouraging networking.

### ✨ Features:
- 🤖 **Automatic Shoutouts:** No need for manual commands—streamers get an automatic shoutout when they chat.
- ⏳ **Cooldown System:** Prevents excessive shoutouts by enforcing a 4-hour cooldown per user.
- 🚫 **Ignore List:** The bot will not shoutout known Twitch bots or the broadcaster.
- 🎮 **Game Information:** When a user is live, the bot includes their current game in the shoutout.
- 🔗 **Twitch IRC Connection:** Seamlessly integrates into Twitch chat without the need for additional configuration.

## ⚡ How the Bot Works
1. When a user chats in your stream, the bot checks:
   - 🕒 If the user has already received a shoutout in the last 4 hours.
   - 🚫 If the user is a known bot (from the ignore list).
   - 🎥 If the user is the broadcaster (the bot does not shout out the channel owner).
2. If all conditions are met, the bot sends a message like:
   ```
   🚀 Hey everyone! Don't miss out on @username's incredible Twitch channel at https://twitch.tv/username! They're a fantastic streamer and a valued member of our community! 🎉
   ```
3. If the user is currently live, the bot includes their viewer count and game:
   ```
   🎉 Check out @username at https://twitch.tv/username! They are live right now with 50 viewers playing Call of Duty! 🔥
   ```
